# # --- 1. Define Tickers and Time Period ---

# # Define the list of stock tickers for our portfolio.
# # We're using a diversified list of well-known, high-liquidity stocks from different sectors.
# # AAPL (Tech), MSFT (Tech), GOOGL (Comm. Services), AMZN (Consumer Disc.), JPM (Financials), JNJ (Healthcare)
# TICKERS = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'JPM', 'JNJ']

# # Define the time range for our historical data.
# # A period of 5-10 years is generally a good starting point for training a trading model.
# # It's long enough to capture different market cycles (bull, bear, sideways).
# START_DATE = '2014-01-01'
# END_DATE = datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d') # Use today's date as the end date

# # --- 2. Create a Directory to Store Data ---

# # Define the path for the directory where we will save our data files.
# # It's a best practice to keep raw data in a separate folder.
# DATA_PATH = 'data'

# # Create the directory if it doesn't already exist.
# # The `exist_ok=True` argument prevents an error from being raised if the directory is already there.
# os.makedirs(DATA_PATH, exist_ok=True)

# # --- 3. Download and Save Data for Each Ticker ---

# print("Starting data download...")

# # Loop through each ticker in our list
# for ticker in TICKERS:
#     print(f"Downloading data for {ticker}...")
#     try:
#         # Use yfinance's download function.
#         # It returns a pandas DataFrame with the historical data.
#         # We specify the ticker, start date, end date, and the interval (daily).
#         data = yf.download(ticker, start=START_DATE, end=END_DATE, interval='1d')

#         # Check if the download was successful and the DataFrame is not empty.
#         if data.empty:
#             print(f"  - No data found for {ticker}. It might be delisted or the ticker symbol is incorrect.")

#             continue
        
#         # Define the full path for the CSV file.
#         # e.g., 'data/AAPL.csv'
#         file_path = os.path.join(DATA_PATH, f"{ticker}.csv")
        
#         # Save the DataFrame to a CSV file.
#         # The `index=True` argument ensures that the date index is saved as the first column in the file.
#         data.to_csv(file_path)
